# Index View

Widget to graph historical index fund data and show stats for different time ranges. Includes data from Robert Shiller on S&P 500, Housing prices, Long interest rates and more.

I haven't done javascript in a while so code is kind of ugly.

## Contributing

You can start up a development server for testing by:

1. Install Ruby and Bundler
2. Run `bundle install` to install the dependencies (mainly Jekyll the static site builder)
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve -w` to start up a development server that will watch for changes.
4. Commit and submit a pull request and I'll probably merge and deploy your contribution.

Most of the code is in `_assets/javascripts/viewer.js`.
